		<div class="container"><div class="about"><p class="introduction">G</p><p> uernica 2.016 was a project for a Unity and Maya class taught by game designer Robert Yang. Our brief was an interactive object based on existing art. This was during the airstrikes against Syria. My political cartoonist background compelled me to recreate Guernica with a predator drone. My intent was to contextualize it for today.</p></div></div>

			<div class="contentGuernica">
					<div class="blurb">My original idea was to model a typical consumer-level drone. I was concerned with the time constraint of the midterm and the complexity of an actual military predator drone, so I sculpted the civilian drone to float over a destroyed landscape. In this early iteration, the painting "Guernica" was used as a floor decoration in the environment. While the airstrikes in Syria were wrought not by drones but by fighter jets, the predator drone is nonetheless emblematic of modern-day airstrikes and the military industrial complex.<p>
					Our instructor told me that a predator drone would be better. I looked up photos of the predator from all angles. I wanted to recreate it as closely as possible, even though it wouldn't be seen from the front. </div>

<div class="making">2D TO 3D</div>

	<div class="contentGuernica">

				<div class="blurb">A classmate suggested that I render Guernica figures instead of wrapping the painting on the floor. This was great feedback. That said, the figures were tricky to sculpt because I was recreating Picasso's jagged, cubist aesthetic, two-dimensional art, in a three-dimensional digital space. I arrived at a rough look that, despite being rough and sketchy, suit the aesthetic I was going for. </div>
